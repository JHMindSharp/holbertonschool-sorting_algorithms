# C Sorting Algorithms & Complexity Project

This project aims to implement and analyze several sorting algorithms in C language, focusing on their efficiency and algorithmic complexity (Big O notation).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Understand and use Big O notation to evaluate an algorithm's time complexity.
- Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
- Explain what a stable sorting algorithm is.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

## Complexity

Each algorithm is analyzed in terms of time complexity in the best, average, and worst-case scenarios. Details are provided in the specific documentation files for each algorithm.

## Usage

The sorting functions are implemented in C and adhere to specified coding standards. To test an algorithm, compile the corresponding source file with your array or list of data.
